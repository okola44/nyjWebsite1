        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Born a crime by Trevor Noah is not just an unevering account of growing up in South Africa under apartheid but a loves
            letter to the author's remarkable mother.It records Noah’s real story that's a little scary but funny at the same time.
            In this blog,I am going to talk abput Trevor's use of humour and how it enabled him gain friends and overcome crisis.
            
        </p>
<h2>Humour ; </h2>
<p>Humour does not necessarily elicit laughter. In Trevor Noah’s book ‘born a crime’, He uses humor as a channel through which he discusses taboo subjects. This is evident where Trevor introduces a society’s taboos on their belief in supernatural forces such as witchcraft. He tells how his stool was confused for witchcraft and that they had to burn it and pray(he was the one who prayed) to avert any curses.
    <br>Trevor also uses humor to explain the effects of apartheid and how his mom managed to find cracks in the system. He narrates how when they wanted to go out to the park, his mom would invite a colored woman, Queen, while she walked a few steps behind them like she was the maid working for the woman.
    <br>Trevor managed to get out of crisis many times just because of his humor. One day he was walking and behind him was a group of Zulu guys whom he overheard planning to mug him. Thanks to his ability to understand many languages, he understood them and turned to them and in Zulu, he suggested that they could rob some other person together. That is how he saved himself from being mugged.
    <br>Noah narrates how he stole sacrament and was sold out by his classmate during confession. He goes ahead to show us how this allowed him to leave catholic school without second thoughts.
    This shows how rules sometimes are bend by those who make them.
    
    <br>Noah's mom sold their house and put all the money into their garage business. Though they were going through a difficult financial crisis, he found humor from this situation as he narrates how he used to sleep in cars and he says “I got good at sleeping in cars. 
    <em>I know all the best cars to sleep in. The worst were the cheap ones, Volkswagens, low-end Japanese sedans.”</em>When he talks about how they lacked food and used to eat mopane worms which are the cheapest food. He describes it as being a meal for the poor, he says,” poorest of the poor”. 
    <br>Humour enabled Noah to make friends quite easily. As Noah narrates to us his awkward occasionally tragic and frequently humiliating affairs of the heart, he acknowledges that he is a funny guy and that he was welcomed everywhere.
    Trevor got along well with everyone, which enabled him to get a job from Daniel and Bolo as their middle man because he interacted well with black people.

<h2>How are we raising our sons:</h2>
    <p>
    <em>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. 
    The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage. 
</em>Trevor Noah in Born a Crime<br>
    It matters how we raise our sons because the values we instill in them are what will dictate the kind of men they will become in the future.
    <br> We are introduced to Abel Ngisaveni who is described as very charming when he wanted to be, incredibly funny but also mean. He was big too, six foot three, and Noah admits that although he hadn’t hit his mother yet, he could see it coming judging from the way he treated other people becomes Noah’s stepfather but the relationship they have between them is more like a big brother relationship.
     <br>Abel’s second name was Ngisaveni which meant “be afraid” and we later see in the book his name describes him.
    <br>Abel was from Tsonga culture where it was taboo for men to do house chores. Culture plays a great role in how one will turn out.
     culture often determines the values, worldview, attitudes, behavior, and practices of men and women from birth to death. He had a notion of how wives should behave and wanted to impose it on Trevor’s mom. Patricia was a modern woman and did not bow down to the men as Abel’s culture demanded and he found this disrespectful. Trevors mom mocked the culture.
    Abel had a mindset of traditional men who want to be the head and never allow their wives to shine. They want to be in the front seat and take all the credit for any success that comes their way. Abel tried to take his wife away from things that she enjoyed like going to church. 
    <br>He felt intimidated when people attributed his garage’s Mighty mechanics’ success to his wife. He would rather let his business fail than accept his wife’s support and skills to the business. He is so egoistic that he cannot see the supportive nature of his wife and how much they were growing together, the only thing he sees is how people were going to view him and how his wife was outshining him.
    According to psychologist John Mayer,” you are attracted to your opposite because you feel they have something you are not good at.”This explains why Abel married Trevor’s mom, She was so good at things that Abel wasn’t. He however did not appreciate this fact and tried to change her into becoming a traditional woman like the ones he wanted. It is hard to change someone for their good like we see when Patricia tried to make Abel stop smoking weed but instead, he took to drinking alcohol excessively, It is even harder when you are trying to make them do what will not benefit them like Abel was trying to.
